How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

** It showed what lines were added and deleted.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

** It would be time saving and also make the whole process efficient

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

** Doing it manually would require you to keep a track of all
    the changes you've ever done. Automatic makes the work easy and commit whenever you want.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

** Git is more programming oriented where several files can be treated as logical units.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

** git log gives the summary of all the changes in the repo while git diff shows the changes between two given commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

** You can try out various ways of solving a problem since you can revert back to a particular point. Git log and diff are an added advantage.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

** To solve and practice all my problems.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

** Having the history of a file makes a programmer aware of all the changes ever made and also can identify from where the problem is arising.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

** Since Git is more programming oriented, it makes sense to allow saving multiple files in one commit whereas in Google Docs different types of files are used and treated separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

** git log gave me a summary of all changes/commits that have been done. Especially using git log --stat displayed number of insertions and deletions at each commit. git diff helped in identifying the differences in given files. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

** Git enables one to make changes without having to worry about them because using checkout command you can revert back to the previous vesions and also identify where the bugs have changed the functioning.
